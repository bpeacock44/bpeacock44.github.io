Beth:
This year has been a long, difficult one. But it has also been wonderful in many ways. I’m currently working on a PhD in plant pathology at the University of California, Riverside. We have been living in Riverside for just over two years now. I spent January preparing for and taking my qualifying exam - an important (and very intimidating) step in my studies. I passed successfully and spent a relaxing February finalizing preparations for our new baby (Charles Niven Peacock). 

We always say that Charles was the only good thing to come out of 2020. He has been a light in our lives ever since he was born, and learning to be a full-time parent while also being a full-time student has been a challenge. But we three are a great team and with Ian’s help I’ve been able to continue making progress in my research.

I study a citrus disease (it is called Huanglongbing if you are interested). I can work in the lab as much as needed, since Ian can work on his research at home. I also do a lot of research and data analysis at home, so we get to spend a lot of our time with Charles. We’re all healthy and happy!

Charles:
I was born three days before my due date on March 11 at 2:09 pm in Redlands, California. I weighed 7 lbs 2.5 oz, and measured 20.5 inches long.  A week later I took my first road trip to Utah so I could meet my grandparents and so my parents could get some rest. We switched between living in my great-grandma Green’s house, having my Uncle Seth living with us in California, and living at my Grandma Elise’s house during the spring and summer. I grew quickly, and stayed above the 95th percentile in  weight and height in my age group after I turned 2 months old! I enjoy the following: blowing raspberries, duck sounds, playing in the bathtub and trying to lick the faucet, being a runaway bunny, playing in the grass, and stealing daddy’s computer mouse. I dislike the following: the sound of velcro. 

Ian:
I have writer’s block from working on my dissertation and grant proposals. I’m not sure how to write any more. So I will just list all the ways I tried to start this paragraph before I gave up:
	* I tried to convince myself that day that if I didn’t cut the umbilical cord, I wouldn’t be the boy’s father. 
	*  Year six in the PhD at UCLA with no end in sight. 
	* Thirty never looked so good? 
	* It was the best of times, it was the dumbest of times.
